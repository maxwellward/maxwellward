This Asteroids clone was one of the first projects I ever made, and was done while I was still in highschool. Funny enough, I worked on this project in my Computer Studies class while I was supposed to be learning basic Python, but I ended up getting an A in the class anyway because my teacher felt this project was enough of an indication that I knew what I was doing. It also got me an award for Computer Programming that year!

The game is written using the Unity engine and C#. I actually re-visited this project in 2024 to see if I could update it to the latest version of Unity and clean up some of the code a bit, and while I did successfully update it, I never got around to finishing the code cleanup.

While the code may be quite messy, I take being able to recognise that and improve it all these years later as a great indication that I actually *have* gotten better at development over the years, even though it sometimes feels like I still have no idea what I'm doing.

I may revisit this project in the future, as I still want to try and build a table with a TV inside of it, hook up some joysticks, and pop this game onto it to play in my living room.

If you're interested in checking out the game, I believe the latest builds still work on Windows. You can find them [on Github](https://github.com/maxwellward/Asteroids/releases/tag/v0.3-dev).
