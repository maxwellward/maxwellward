Burnout Torches is a Minecraft plugin that you can install on your server to make torches placed in the world "burn out" after a set amount of time, compared to the standard behaviour of torches lasting forever. 

This was one of my first projects that I got to a "completed" state as I was getting started with software development, and I still look back on it fondly even if there's undoubtedly plenty of issues with it.

The project is written in Java (as most Minecraft mods/plugins are, though you can also use Kotlin now) and was created in response to a request from someone on the [Spigot Forums](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/torches-go-out-at-a-set-time.427566/#post-3750087).

Looking back on it, I'm quite proud of 16 year old me for following through and completing the request, and implementing the (very kind) feedback given by another member of the community.

I may revisit this project and update it to the latest versions of Minecraft at some point, though my Java is a bit rusty these days so I'd have to touch up on that first!
