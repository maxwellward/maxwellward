I woke up at around 8am, and eventually got up and ready at around 9am. As I walked back to the car I saw a Lucid (the car brand) mobile service van which isn’t something I’ve seen before. I’ve had the Tesla mobile service come to my house, but I didn’t know Lucid did the same thing. I talked to the technician a for a few minutes and he said they’re starting with the east coast, but are planning to expand west as they get more technicians and such.

I then got on the road towards Virginia Beach, only about an hour away. I met up with my friend Sarah at a farmers market where we got strawberry coated donuts (Virginia Beach is big into strawberries, they put it in everything). They were pretty good, but I’m still bias towards my hometown donuts. After eating our donuts in a little grassy area, we went to a boba tea place so I could do some work on my laptop, as I needed to get some stuff done for someone today, and needed internet to do it.

I expected it to only take about an hour, but it ended up taking about two and a half hours. I felt pretty bad but Sarah didn’t mind, and after work and enjoying some boba, we headed to our next destination: a strawberry field for strawberry picking! As we arrived there were two police cars at the entrance, with two other cars that had seemingly got into a crash, with one of them having a completely mashed up front bumper. We were still able to get in just fine though and it didn’t look like anyone was hurt.

We paid $25 for a bucket which we can then take with us into the field and pick as many strawberries as we can fit in it. We spent about 30 minutes in the field picking, and at first we were the only people there. As time went on another few groups arrived but it wasn’t crowded by any means. Sarah was pretty picky about the strawberries she picked whereas I on the other hand was a lot more generous and less selective of my pickings. I think the ones I picked were pretty good though, and I’d occasionally eat one right after picking it even though you’re not technically supposed to do that.

After picking, we went to a nice Korean barbecue place near where the boba place was earlier. It was pretty cheap and quite good, definitely a place I’d go back to if I’m in Virginia Beach again. We didn’t spend long there, but also coincidentally ran into Sarah’s mum and brother who came in to pick up some food as well. After eating we headed back to Sarah’s house and said hi to her parents, before going to a snow cone place a few minutes away. I’ve never really had a snow cone so I wasn’t really sure what to expect, but it wasn’t really that complicated and was just what you’d think, crushed ice with flavouring in it.

After our snow cones we went back to Sarah’s house, where her mum offered to let me stay in the guest room rather than going to a rest area for the night. I quickly accepted the offer as a proper bed is always superior to the back of the car. We all hung out in the living room for a while talking and such, answering all the Canadian questions they had, along with giving them some Canadian money (a thing I do pretty often, since Americans always seem to be fascinated by our money).

I went to bed around 10 and, in the very comfortable bed, fell asleep.
