Today was a pretty chill day, we didn’t do much and woke up pretty late (around noon). I had been drifting in and out of sleep all morning because of the storm that was going on, with super super loud thunder every few minutes that would shake the windows, and rain that seemed to never stop.

My deal for Kyle joining me for the next leg of the trip was pretty simple. I was going that way myself anyway, so if he wanted to come along he’d just have to pay for his own food, and I’d pay for everything else. Because of this deal, Kyle came up with a pretty good idea: DoorDash.

DoorDash is something both of us do on the side for some extra money, since it’s also kind of fun, but he was right: DoorDash could easily pay for food during the trip. His goal was to end the trip either net neutral or net positive in terms of money. As a bonus, if we earned a surplus of $400, he could use that to pay his rent, and he could stay even longer on the trip.

So it was settled, we’d occasionally DoorDash to pay for our food on the trip, with the goal of earning an extra $400. This will work out pretty well actually, since we can’t visit capitol buildings after dark (since the photos would be bad), so we can drive until the first medium-sized city before the capital, do DoorDash, go to bed, then visit the capital in the morning.

With nothing else to really do today, we ended up doing DoorDash for a few hours to start building up our “nest-egg” before we set off tomorrow. We did pretty well, getting almost $100 USD in a few hours. Having two people makes it really easy, since I drop Kyle off at the entrance to the store and then turn around or park while he’s inside, so we’re ready to set off right away. It’s pretty fun to maximize the efficiency as we go too.

It was made a little harder due to the storm, which was still very much ongoing. Half way through our dash we got an emergency alert over the radio for an extreme thunderstorm warning, which was kind of funny given it had been stormier earlier in the day, but oh well.

We also stopped at a McDonalds to get the “Minecraft Meal”, which isn’t actually all that interesting. It’s a collaboration between McDonalds and Mojang as advertising for the Minecraft Movie, and it’s just a basic chicken nugget and fries meal packaged inside a Minecraft-style box, and comes with a collectible card and figurine. I got a “Birdie Wings” character, which is someone I’ve never heard of in all my 10+ years of playing Minecraft. Odd.

We headed home late, hung around at home for a bit, then called it a night since we needed to leave the house at 11am tomorrow to go see Kyle’s parents an hour north in Lebanon, Missouri.
