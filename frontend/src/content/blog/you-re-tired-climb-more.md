Today was a pretty chill day. When I say there’s not much to write about I mean it this time. We really just woke up late, worked more on our project from the hackathon earlier this week, and relaxed at home. David had some work to do, so he was working on that, and in the afternoon I drove Claire to a meeting she had at the university and picked her up after.

Later, around 7pm, we went back to the climbing gym where I was able to use one of David’s friends free pass, so I just had to pay the $6 for shoes and I was good to go. David was there to wish a friend a happy birthday and do some training with his team, while Claire and I got me up on the higher climbing walls that require a harness and belayer (Claire is certified to do belaying, so she was happy to do it for me). 

I climbed 4 or 5 times, by which point my arms were completely giving up on me and I couldn’t lift myself up at all or hold on to the wall very easily. The fatigue from the first day of climbing was still getting to my arms, and adding on even more climbing didn’t help that. Climbing is just like any workout though, the more you do it, the easier it gets and the less muscle fatigue you’ll experience. But for now, I still have to deal with that fatigue.

After we finished climbing, Claire and I went and got a table at the brewery next door while David finished up with his team. It was trivia night at the brewery, so it was packed and very loud. We were given a sheet to use if we wanted to follow along with the trivia, but despite trying a bit, we only got one and it was because it was a “name this song” question and Claire recognized it. David joined us a few minutes later and we all got some food and just chatted for an hour or so.

Afterward, we headed home, worked a bit more on our project, and turned in for bed.
