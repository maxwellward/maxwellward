We woke up pretty early today, around 7am, and got ready for the day. We didn’t need to check out of our accommodation until noon, which was an extremely generous amount of time, and so we got to hang out a bit in the morning and relax. Claire used the Steam Deck to play some games with David, while I did some work on my laptop. I also booked my flights to New York for Pokemon GO fest, from the 6th to the 10th of June. The price went up since I last looked, so I ended up paying $330 for the flight from Waterloo round trip, but it’s still not too bad. The bad part though, is that the first leg (Waterloo to Toronto) is via bus, which is no fun, but it is what it is.

Claire then decided to go to the local bakery to try and get some better food than the last bakery we tried, and so she donned her rain gear and headed out into the rainy morning, while I stayed back and kept working. The bakery was about a 15 minute walk away, and after about 10 minutes I got a text from Claire, who had discovered her rain gear was no longer waterproof, and informing me that she was now soaked. She asked if I could pick her up in the car from the bakery, which of course I agreed to, and got right in the car and headed to the bakery.

Once there, Claire offered to buy me something, so I picked out a small lemon meringue pie, which she also decided to get one of. While ordering and paying, she asked if she could practice her French with the staff member, who agreed, and they had a short exchange in French that was quite a bit over my current French level, but right around Claire’s. Once we had our items, we went back to the car and drove back to the house, where we ate our breakfast and finished getting ready for the morning, filled out the guest book using Google translated French, and then packed up and headed out.

Our goal today was Fredricton, New Brunswick, where we’d stay the night before going to Saint John tomorrow. The drive was very, very long, over 6 hours, but relatively easy. We wanted to try and make it out of Quebec before filling up with gas, but realized we wouldn’t make it, and so had to pay the 10c/L extra in Quebec compared to New Brunswick. Canadian roads also feature some very long navigation names, as shown below.

We reached New Brunswick around 3pm, and were able to pull safely off the highway at the sign to take some photos before carrying on. The sign was covered in stickers, which was interesting since the one entering Quebec wasn’t.

We got to Fredricton and stopped at a Superstore (which here are called “Atlantic Superstore”) to pick up some food for tonight, including some more noodles and bananas, which are becoming a staple of this part of the trip. We’ve also completely fallen for the Loblaws marketing trick of their stamp scheme, where for every $20 you spend you get one stamp, and after 15 stamps you get 75% off a 2-pack of nice water or wine glasses. Loblaws is bad, by the way, and that feels necessary to say.

We got to our Airbnb (also bad) at 8pm and got ourselves unpacked, before I heated up my noodles, Claire toasted her bread-pizza thing, and we both separately worked on our own things for the rest of the night before going to bed.
