We woke up today to the mostly final results of the election, a Liberal victory by a small margin, but still not knowing if it’ll be a majority or minority government. We kept the TV on in the living room as we ate breakfast and got ready for the day, watching the counts get finalized and hearing the stories we missed from the rest of the night and early morning.

We then went to Canadian Tire (also across the road, just like the Montanas) where we bought 3 big bags of dirt which are going to be mixed into the dirt in the back garden to start growing some food (Claire seemed excited to grow carrots). None of us are very knowledgeable about dirt or growing things, so we asked the friendly Canadian Tire workers who gave us some advice and pointed us in the right direction. Loading up the car with heavy bags of dirt was a little sketchy given the back already sits pretty low, but given we were only driving about 400m we figured it would be okay, and it was. We unloaded the dirt, which we weren’t going to use today, but rather they would do themselves another time, and then headed back inside.

After Claire attended a few more meetings, we got on to our next event of the day: the Minecraft Movie. I’ve already seen it, as you’ll know if you’ve been reading these since the start, but the others haven’t seen it, and so we were all going to go see it with one of David and Claire’s friends, Val. Val picked us up around 2:45pm and we drove to the theatre, anxious about being late given the movie started at 3:10. We bought our tickets on the way, which wasn’t an issue since the seat map was basically empty, and since it was Tuesday the tickets are cheap and we only paid $24 for all four tickets.

Since I paid for the tickets, David paid for the popcorn, which in usual movie theatre style was exorbitantly expensive, coming to $22 for two medium popcorns and a medium drink. Despite that sticker shock, we settled in and enjoyed the movie, which was just as “eh” as I remember it being the first time. I spent more time this watch looking out for cameos and the like, as the movie has a number of them from Minecraft content creators that I know of.

During the movie we heard a faint whoosh noise for about ten minutes, which at first I thought was in the movie, but then it went on too long to fit, and I didn’t recall hearing it the first time. We disregarded it and promptly forgot about it though. After the movie, the others followed suite in my opinion of the movie being fine, and we made our way out of the theatre.

The next stop was The Round Table, a board game cafe a few minutes from the theatre. As we walked in, I commented on the fact it was pretty dark in there, but for some reason I thought it was just the style of the place. We then found out that they actually had no power, and that only about 30 minutes earlier they’d had a massive storm that lasted all of 10 minutes before promptly disappearing again, leaving a trail of destruction as it went.

As they had no power, they weren’t able to stay open, so we obviously couldn’t stay and play games, so we decided to go home and hang out there instead. On our way back, we realized how blind we’d been driving from the theatre to the cafe in the first place, as we now noticed all the downed trees, non-operational traffic lights, and even a downed traffic signal with a police car blocking it off in the road. It turns out that whooshing noise we heard in the theatre for 10 minutes or so was that storm being so loud we could hear it off the roof of the theatre.

Despite the storm, our area still had power and so we were able to spend the rest of the evening playing Wii games, including the amazing Wii Family Adventure, a game that uses a play mat with sensors in it as the controller (basically just a different form of a GameCube controller). Think of one of those Dance Dance Revolution mats but slightly different. The game was, fine, but oddly addicting, and made us pair up into teams to see which team can get the most points in a variety of mini games.

We played games and hung around until about 11pm when Val headed home and we all called it a night.
