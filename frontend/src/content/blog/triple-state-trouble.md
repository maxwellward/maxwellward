Today was also a speedrunning day, 3 capitals and ending the day with Kyle in Springfield was the plan. I started driving around 9:30 am and got to the capital at 10:15 am, and while still a cool building, was kind of underwhelming compared to the others I’ve seen.

I had to park a few blocks away since all the lot parking was private, and all the street parking was full. But I found a spot in front of some houses and was able to walk to the capitol building in only a few minutes.

I also saw this statue of a gorilla in someones yard:

Lincoln to Topeka was a pretty easy drive, mostly single lane in either direction and nice views in all directions. A couple of trucks that would go under the speed limit, then speed up when a passing lane opened up which gets really frustrating after a while, but all in all it was an enjoyable drive.

I was able to get parking right in front of the capitol building, so I just had to walk across the street to get my photo. I paid 50 cents for the parking, but I probably could have got away with not paying given how short of a time I was there.

I then took the Kansas Turnpike Toll Road pretty much all the way to Jefferson City, Missouri. I don’t know if I’ve mentioned it before, but as a Canadian, I can technically drive through any tolls in the US without paying. This is because the US doesn’t have a way of billing Canadians (except if you’re from Ontario) via mail, since the provinces don’t share license information with the states. Even if I wanted to pay, the Drive Kansas website doesn’t recognize my car and won’t let me even view my outstanding tolls.

There was a parking lot down the hill from the Missouri Capitol, so I parked there and took a short walk up the hill. I wanted to try to get to Springfield before dark or soon after dark, so I couldn’t stay long as it was already 5:30 and I had another 3 hours to Springfield.

I headed on for Springfield, which took me along a beautiful route through the Ozark Lake area which looks really cool on a map, and still pretty cool in person, especially during golden hour. All the trees and flowers are blooming right now which meant there were pink and purple accents to the bushes, which made it a much more pleasant drive than the barren wastelands of the midwest.

I got to Springfield at around 8pm, where Kyle and I hung out at home as I finally got my website posts section up and running, where I’m now posting these.
