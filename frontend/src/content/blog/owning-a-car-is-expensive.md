I woke up at around 7 and had one of the worst brainrot sessions I’ve had yet, watching Instagram reels until about 9am. This really needs to stop, I never feel good after it and it’s really a waste of time. Once finally up, I took a shower and got ready for the day. We filled up my cars oil, since I hadn’t done that in a while and it definitely needed it, before heading over to a tire shop. 

My cars alignment has been bad for a while now, and it’s significantly worn down the right side tires in an uneven manner, so I finally decided to get new tires. It’s expensive, but worth it so I don’t slide of the road and crash. We dropped off the car, got a quote of $400 USD for the tires and alignment, which isn’t as bad as it could have been. The tires for the Tesla at home are over double that, so that’s definitely one benefit of having a lighter, older car.

Sarah then drove us both over to Mount Trashmore, a big park that was constructed from an old landfill by placing a huge tarp-like material over top and then layering dirt and grass over that, along with normal park features like paths and benches. The view of the hill remind me a little bit of the Windows XP wallpaper: “Bliss”. It’s a pretty cool place but there’s not a ton to do, so after about 20 minutes we went back to the car and headed downtown.

Downtown Virginia beach isn’t really too busy since most of the visitors go to the waterfront, but there’s still some cool places. We went to a chocolate store where Sarah got me a few pieces, along with some crumble, and she got a cup of chocolate and strawberries. We then walked next door to the Lego store, where I played my game of finding the most expensive Lego set they have, this time being about $600 USD for a Harry Potter set. I also bought a gift for a friend, which I can’t say here otherwise it may spoil the surprise for them.

We then drove to the local high school/university where Sarah’s brother Jacob was at an engineering club. I got to see what they’re working on, along with taking a look at their wood shop and other tools like their 3D printers and laser cutters. We didn’t stay very long though as we had our next thing coming up quick: a movie with a meal!

We drove to the local theatre which is pretty unique in one specific way: they bring full meals to you while you watch the movie. You still have to pay of course, but they come around every so often and take your order, and then as you’re watching your movie they’ll bring it to you and you can enjoy it while you watch. It’s a little bit of a weird experience, and naturally leads to quite a bit more sound in the theatre (there were also young kids near us that wouldn’t stop standing up and talking), but overall I really enjoyed it. We watched Lilo and Stitch, and while I haven’t seen the original, I still quite liked this “remake” (maybe?) of it.

We then went to a small farmers market at a cute little farmhouse. It wasn’t too big, and they seemed to have started packing up when we arrived but it was still a nice place to see. If we hadn’t just eaten, they also had food trucks there along with a bunch of places to sit.

After perusing the farmers market for a bit, we headed back home and waited for my car to be ready while we watched Shark Tale and I worked on my blog posts. About an hour later the car was ready, so we went to pick it up. They gave me a sheet that showed the old versus new alignment, and they’re right, it definitely needed to be done. I paid the bill and drove the car home, to which I definitely noticed the improvement in how it drives now.

Once we got home we enjoyed a meal of Bourbon Salmon which was exceptional, before hanging out a little bit more in the living room. I found out that the game “Wingspan” (the same game Sophia and I played in Toronto) is on the Nintendo Switch, which is pretty neat, and was the game of choice for some of the family before I headed to bed, knowing I had to get up early the next day to go pick up Jackson in Richmond.
