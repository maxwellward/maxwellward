I slept in a bit, setting my alarm for 9am, knowing that if I woke up at 6:30am I’d be completely dead for the whole day. While I was getting up, Claire went to go see what the free breakfast had, which turned out to just be 2 apples. Great breakfast, thanks Travelodge. We cleaned up the car a bit and checked to see if the dash cam had saved the clip from the moose incident last night, which it has (I just need an adapter to get the footage since I forgot mine), and then got on the road. We almost forgot to go to Grand Falls, the grandest falls in Grand Falls, but Claire remembered in time and we turned around and headed to the waterfall.

It definitely lives up to its name, and dumps more water per second over the edge than Niagara Falls (in Niagara’s off season where the least water is present). It’s pretty wild that I’ve never heard of this waterfall before, but I’m definitely glad we were able to see it. The visitor centre nearby was nice as well, and we had some good conversations with the people there about our trip and about the waterfall in general. We picked up some stuff at the gift store before heading on.

After a stop at the Real Atlantic Superstore (not sure why they separate them from our west coast “Real Canadian Superstore”) for some snacks, we carried on towards Quebec City, where we got a hostel room in the centre of Old Quebec for a crazy cheap $85. For a full room with 3 beds (one double bed and a bunk bed), that’s a really good deal. It’s a shared bathroom, but you can’t expect much more for the price, and the other shared amenities (like a full kitchen and beautiful courtyard) are great. We did have to pay $12.50 for parking at a nearby hotel, but it’s only a few moments away and is a small price to pay for this location.

Claire went for a walkabout while I worked on some stuff on my laptop, and then a few hours later we were ready to eat. We met back up and went to the car to pick some things up, and then walked 10 minutes to our restaurant of choice: “Bistro St-Malo”, a French restaurant that was relatively expensive but looked really nice. Upon arriving, we were seated upstairs. Claire got a goose dish, and I got a chicken-based dish, and we dove in. I kid you not, this was some of the best chicken I’d ever had. It fell off the bone so easily and tasted so good, and the fries on the side were a perfect blend of crispy and soft that is impossible to describe with justice. If you’re ever in Quebec City and looking for a nice meal, Bistro St-Malo is the place to go.

After dinner, we walked back to our hostel where I worked on writing these posts, and Claire called David for a bit before we headed to bed, ready to go back to Montreal in the morning.
