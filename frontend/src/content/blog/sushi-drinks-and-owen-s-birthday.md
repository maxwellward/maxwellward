Today was the main event, Santa Fe! We all got together for lunch with 2 of their friends that they went to the event with the night before and we all had breakfast, where I subjected them to Canadian geography tests (they did not do well), and we all tried authentic Canadian maple syrup which they enjoyed.

Afterward, the 3 of us headed to Santa Fe, only an hour away, to an exhibit type thing called “Meow Wolf”. They had suggested it to me a while ago, and I agreed and then deliberately didn’t look up anything about it or have anyone explain it to me as I wanted it to be a surprise. I pretty much figured it out by the time we arrived, and it was a super cool experience.

It’s basically a giant art exhibit where a house has been built inside a warehouse, and inside that house are a bunch of fancy rooms and places to explore, and the further back you go the less it resembles a house. You can walk through the fireplace to an open cavern of whale bones that make noise when you hit them, or through the closet door to a fancy moss-laden cave, and much more. There’s also a story to follow with a kind of mystery you can solve, but it was way too busy for us to properly focus on all of those things, so we just skimmed most of it.

After we spent a few hours there, we headed to the Capitol Building to get the photos. It wasn’t busy since it was a Saturday, so we were able to park in the 30 minute loading zone and quickly get the photos. As far as state capitol buildings go, it wasn’t the best one, I think that award still goes to California. It wasn’t the worst though, and definitely better than Arizona I think.

We then headed back to Albuquerque (which I still can’t spell properly without help) and to a sushi restaurant that was focused around delivering your sushi with boats! It’s not quite conveyor belt sushi since you still order what you want and then wait for it to come, rather than picking from the belt when you see something good, but it was a really fun experience.

People were writing on napkins and sending them around on the boats, and so we’d occasionally get questions like “where are you from?” or “what’s your favourite sushi roll?” which we could add to and put back on the boats for the next person. We even got one that said it was Owen’s birthday, so we all wrote happy birthday to this mysterious Owen!

We finished up our sushi and then headed out to a bar/entertainment place called “Main Event”, where we played some arcade games, pool, and went bowling, all while having a very “reasonable” and “normal” amount to drink. Don’t fact check me on that.

We left around 2am and got back to our hotel which we all split for the night, where we tried to watch Kung Fu Panda but couldn’t get the casting to the TV to work, and ended up just calling it a night.
