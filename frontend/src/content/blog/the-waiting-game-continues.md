Today was really just a hang around day. We’re still waiting on the Canadian Embassy to receive my ballot, which I’m getting less and less hopeful for it arriving on time. We got up around 9am before walking around the apartment complex mapping path ways, trees, and parking lots. We did that for about an hour before it started to rain and we headed inside.

After the rain stopped, we headed out and did some DoorDash for a few hours, where I got to see some koi fish in someone’s pond! We also got to see more of the are surrounding McHenry which is mostly farm land and lakes, which makes for some nice scenery. While driving around we passed the McHenry outdoor theatre, which Kyle remembers very fondly, and reminds me of the outdoor theatre from Back to the Future part 3.

We also found out that there was (or is?) a proposed gravel pit a processing plant right near the outdoor theatre, which the local residents heavily oppose (for good reason). We were doing some research on it and couldn’t find any updates past 2023, and since there isn’t a massive hole in the ground we figured the project had been successfully stopped.

The highlight of the day was dinner though. We went to a local pub in downtown McHenry called the Fox Hole, which is known for its pizza. While we weren’t getting deep dish this time, I was still excited for it. The pub is fully underground, so you don’t have any windows or anything and it feels pretty dark, and the TV’s are very loud, which for a mostly empty pub is a bit of a weird feeling. They also didn’t have wifi which was a bit of a bummer. Despite this, the pizza was very good and I enjoyed the experience, and if I was local I would definitely be back. I can see it being busier when it’s not a Tuesday night as well.

We also saw a very patriotic Cybertruck on our way back to the car.
