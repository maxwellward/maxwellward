There’s not a whole lot to write about today, since we’re still just waiting on the Canadian Embassy to call and say my voting kit has arrived. 

We woke up pretty late, given our late night last night, and got going around 1pm. We drove right to Lancing, the capital of Michigan, and went to get our photo. We noticed that some of the manhole covers downtown were steaming pretty excessively, which turns out to be because they use steam-based heating in some of their buildings downtown, similar to how New York City does it (that’s why you see steam rising there as well).

We got our photos, noting how empty the city felt, especially on a Saturday. With not much else to do, we decided to do some more DoorDash and ended up doing that for the rest of the evening all the way through until 10pm, when we stopped to get pizza and go to our rest stop.

I’ve also been getting really into mapping places on OpenStreetMap, an open-source collaborative map of the world. Currently I’m mapping a tiny town in Alabama named Talladega Springs by adding things like driveways, forests, houses, lakes, and fixing roads to better line up with how they look in real life. It’s really fun and a good way to kill some time on my phone if there’s nothing else to do.

We got to our rest area late, but not super late, around midnight, and went to bed pretty quick, not wanting to continue messing up our sleep schedule too badly.
