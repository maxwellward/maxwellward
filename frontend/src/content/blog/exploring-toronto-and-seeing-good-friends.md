We all woke up around 7am, since Joah and Madeleine needed to get to work. We hung out for a bit in the morning and had some breakfast, before the other two left and I was left by myself (with the cat). I stayed home for a little bit and did some work on my laptop before deciding to head out into the city. The apartment is really well situated, only a 5 minute walk from the nearest subway station which can take you downtown in about 10 or 15 minutes.

I got off at Union station and walked to the TD towers complex to look around, since I needed to pick up a friend there tomorrow, at 2pm on a long weekend Friday, and I wanted to figure out the temporary parking situation. I eventually figured it out, and then decided to keep walking a bit further away from the financial district to city hall, which houses a Toronto Public Library branch where I planned to do some work.

It was a pretty nice walk, though I did almost get hit by someone turning right on red. I got to city all and took a photo of the Toronto sign out front, along with some birds who were climbing the arches over the pond, despite the sign saying no climbing. How silly of them. I then walked along the right side of the building where the library is, but couldn’t find an entrance. I kept looking around for one, but ended up walking all the way around the building before getting to the front again, walking inside city hall, and realizing the entrance to the library is directly to your right when you walk in. Oopsie.

City hall also has this really cool piece of artwork on the wall made of different lengths and colours of nails.

I sat and worked for a few hours and finished catching up on my blog posts, before packing up and heading to the Eaton Center, a nearby mall, for some lunch. Even on a Thursday it was super busy, and I think this is just a big city thing, but malls are definitely still very full. Rural malls on the other hand are really struggling, but that makes more sense with the rise in fast shipping from online retailers.

After lunch, it was getting closer to when Joah would be home, so I headed back towards his place and stopped at their nearby library branch first. I stayed there for a few hours and did some more work, but was frustrated to find that some of my developer tools don’t work on public library networks, which is really annoying. After a few hours there I walked the 15 minutes back to the apartment, and though Joah wasn’t home yet, Madeleine was, so we just hung out in the living room and worked on our stuff until Joah was home.

Once Joah got back, we packed up a bit and went out for dinner at a sushi restaurant further downtown called “Kyoto House”. It was surprisingly cheap for Toronto, and I ate just the right amount of food to fill me up, and only paid $18. After catching up over food, we all headed back home and hung out at home, watching “Surf’s Up” (fantastic movie, by the way) while building IKEA furniture.

Around midnight we all decided it was too late to keep staying up, since both the others had to work in the morning, and we decided to head to bed.
