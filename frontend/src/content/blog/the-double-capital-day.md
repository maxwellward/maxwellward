Okay, time to speedrun. Up first is Cheyenne, the capital of Wyoming. It was a quick and easy drive with ample parking on the street which made it easy to hop out, get the photo, and hop back in. My goal today was to also go to Denver, Colorado and Lincoln, Nebraska today in preparation to get to Springfield, Missouri tomorrow where my friend Kyle lives.

After a quick stop, it was also a pretty easy drive to Denver, though it’s a much bigger city so parking was a lot harder to find. I arrived around 3:30pm, and after driving around a bit and assessing the street parking situation (and finding out that “easy” parking on Google Maps was a lie), I found an underground parking garage at a bank that was $2 per 12 minutes. Since I didn’t expect to take long, this was fine.

Denver reminds me a lot of cities like Toronto and Vancouver. People everywhere, tall buildings, and confusing construction layouts. Additionally there were a lot of interesting characters around, similar to Vancouver, but none of them were of any threat.

Right in front of the state capital is also the city and county government for Denver, which is also in a pretty cool building.
