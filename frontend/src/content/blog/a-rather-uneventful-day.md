Not much to write today, but we’re heading back to Montreal! It’s only a few hours from Quebec City to Montreal, so we were able to sleep in a bit, and got going around 10am. Claire got me a croissant from a local bakery which I ate along the way. It was a relatively uneventful drive, and along the way Claire was trying to get in touch with her friend to confirm arrival details. We didn’t end up being able to get ahold of her friend until we eventually called them as we were arriving in the city, and they told us they were at work until 3, so we went to a grocery store with a seating area upstairs where we did individual work for a bit until we were ready to go meet Claire’s friend.

Claire was going to stay the night with her friend, but they didn’t have space for me to also stay, so I booked a hotel closer to the centre of Montreal. I was able to leave my car with them though, so I didn’t have to drive in Montreal more or pay for parking. It was a 10 minute walk to the metro station, which was then a short 15 minute ride to the hotel. I picked up some food, got myself checked in, and sat in bed to watch some YouTube videos for a bit before working on some projects.

While watching, there was a knock on the door, which upon opening I was greeted by a French-speaking man who apologized, clearly either having the wrong room or not expecting me to be there, and he left. Oh well, nothing weird I thought, and went back to watching my videos. A few minutes later, another knock, and it’s the same man, this time holding his phone out with  a translation on it from French to Spanish. “Je parles anglais”, I said, to which he apologized and changed the translation to English. It basically said he was an employee and needed to glue some wood onto the wall, which I connected in my head as being the wood strips going up the wall for decoration, which had a few slightly coming off at the bottom.

I let him in and tried to sit not-awkwardly as he tried to glue the wood back on, but he was seemingly struggling with it. Eventually he called someone else on the phone, to which I could hear whoever he called in another room, so I assumed it was his boss or colleague. I couldn’t make out everything they said, but it seemed to be along the lines of “This isn’t working, let’s do this tomorrow”. It was almost 5pm, so it made sense that he probably just wanted to not deal with it while I was there and do it tomorrow when the room was empty.

We said our pleasantries and he left, leaving me to finish watching my videos and work on my projects. I also took a shower, since despite not being an evening shower person, I knew I had to leave at 7:15am tomorrow and wouldn’t have enough time to shower. Around 10pm I settled in for bed and had a very nice sleep.
