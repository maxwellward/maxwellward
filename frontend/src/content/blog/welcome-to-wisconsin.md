The next few days don’t really have much going on. Still waiting on the Canadian embassy, we drove up to Milwaukee on our way to see Kyle’s uncle in McHenry. We stopped at Veterans Park where we walked around while Kyle played Pokemon GO, and I mapped out the benches and trees in the park. We didn’t stay too long in Milwaukee because it was cold and windy, but it was nice to see part of the city and at least say I’ve been there.

From there we drove to a local Whole Foods, where we used their free microwave to heat up the food we got in Chicago last night and finish it off. While we were there, I also picked up some “Cookies and Cream Chocolate Pretzels”, which looked a lot better than they tasted. While here, I also found out that Kyle didn’t know that Whole Foods was owned by Amazon, and after telling him that disappointing fact, I showed him the entire list of things owned by Amazon, which is a massive list.

After the Whole Foods experience we got back on the road and headed for the Wisconsin State Capitol building in Madison. It was only about an hour away, and we found street parking just down the block. It was a quick walk up to the building, where it looked like they were doing some kind of cleaning of the stone as there was a worker up on a lift brushing the stones off with a broom. We quickly got our photos, looked at some very busy squirrels, and then carried on our way towards McHenry to see Kyle’s uncle, John.

We arrived in the late afternoon and spent the rest of the evening hanging out with John. A bit later we also decided to go out for dinner at the local Wingstop, since we’d been thinking about it for a while. It ended up being okay, and while I don’t think I’d go back but I don’t regret going.

We ended the day by watching “How it’s Made” on the TV, where we learned how frozen French toast is made, before falling asleep on the very comfortable reclining chairs in John’s living room.
