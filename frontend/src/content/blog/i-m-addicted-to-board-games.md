We woke up pretty late today, around 10 or 11, since we were quite tired from last night. After a slow morning we decided to head to a Denny’s downtown, since Sophia had never been, despite seeing it in shows and such so often. She was absolutely flabbergasted by Denny’s and had a great time, and her socks were quote, “knocked so far off they were on the street”. We spent about an hour at Denny’s enjoying our breakfast and chatting, before heading back on to the street.

We walked a few blocks to a board game cafe we had seen on the way to Denny’s, and decided to stop in and see what it was like. We planned to stay about an hour or two and play a few games, but we ended up staying for 7 hours. That’s not a typo, we stayed at the board game cafe for 7 hours. They had a menu you could access on your phone and have items brought to your table, and so we ended up having a bubble tea when we first arrived, along with a full dinner later on. We ended up spending about $50 each, which for 7 hours of play and food is extremely reasonable. If you’re in Toronto, I highly recommend Juju Cafe & Board Games.

After the cafe, I remembered I hadn’t paid for parking, and so was technically 2 hours unpaid. I gave Joah a call, who by now was home, and he was happy to run down and pay it for me, and I just e-transferred him the $12. He couldn’t get in the car to put it under the windshield of course, so he just put it under the wipers and we hoped it wouldn’t get damaged by the light rain that was now falling.

We walked from the cafe to the CN Tower, where we admired its high for a moment before spotting a Beaver Tails van. If you don’t know what a Beaver Tail is, it’s a Canadian delicacy of a beaver tail shaped pastry covered in any combination of toppings, ranging from traditional sweet toppings like chocolate, to more savory toppings like a simple lemon coating. We had just eaten, so we didn’t get one today, but we planned to come back tomorrow and get one after we went to the aquarium which was right next door.

Right across from the CN Tower is one of the greatest things ever: a free, outdoor train museum complete with mini tracks, full sized tracks, a turntable, and multiple train cars from old GO train cars to cabooses. Though, before I could get to it, I was put on a short leash for jaywalking in front of a taxi, something I’m much more positively inclined to doing than Sophia, who likes to wait for the walk signal almost every time. The leash was quite short, being quite literally the length of the lanyard she uses for work, but I was quickly released once we safely made it to the other side of the road and I was free to explore the train museum.

After looking at cool trains for a while, we headed back to the subway and headed home. We dropped some stuff off at home and then walked to Joah and Madilyn’s house to put the parking pass inside my car, rather than leaving it out overnight. We decided to count the number of steps to the apartment, to which I guessed 500, and it ended up being 420, pretty close! We put the pass inside, put my SD card back in the dash cam, and walked back home.

We looked at some ideas for cutting my hair, since it was getting time for a haircut, and Sophia was going to do it for me. Once we settled on a style, we went and cut my hair. As usual, at first I was spooked by it, since it was quite different from what I had before, but after the initial shock wore off, I was very happy with it, and it was kind of nice to have short hair again. 

Afterward, I put my laundry in the machine and we hung out for the rest of the night until my laundry finished and we could go to bed.
