While today is still another day of waiting, it’s also car repair day! John’s neighbour was a bit hard to get ahold of, and being a mechanic he also likely didn’t really want to look at the car after a full day of working on cars (he didn’t say this, but we can presume). Though, despite his broken leg, John was happy to try and take a look for us himself. We took the car for a loop around the apartment to show him the noise, which was definitely still present, before taking off the front left tire and getting under the car to take a look.

The consensus in the end was that it was a worn out control arm bushing causing the clunking noise. While not an urgent repair, and definitely still drivable, if it got any worse we’d definitely want to have it looked at. At the same time we also looked at the problematic tire and found the leak using soap and water. It’s a small leak on the outside, definitely fixable, but rather than spending money on that we just threw on the full-size spare tire which holds air no problem. The leaky tire is now our spare tire, which despite the leak is still good as a temporary spare should we need it.

We then headed out to do some more DoorDash, where we got started with a wild offer of $15 for 10 orders batched into one. While more orders may sound good, it’s not. The number of stops we’d need to make would cause it to take a really long time, and that $15 basically works out to $1.50 per order. Even though the pickup was all at the same location, it still wasn’t worth it. Despite declining It, we were offered the same set of orders another 5 times before we clocked out and decided to wait a bit, to avoid continually hurting our acceptance rate.

We DoorDashed for the rest of the day before heading home, hanging out in the living room for a bit, and calling it a night around midnight.
