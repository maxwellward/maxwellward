I woke up around 7 am to shower and get ready before the maintenance people came to do some work on the apartment at 9 am, but I couldn’t get Kyle up, and the maintenance people never showed up! So I ended up just scrolling Instagram reels for a few hours until we left around 11 am.

We headed downtown where we played some Pokemon GO together. It was raining pretty badly so we were mostly hopping between different spots to take cover. We ended up in the movie theater downtown, where we bought tickets to “A Minecraft Movie” for 3:30 pm. While we were there, thunder was shaking the windows, and one strike even shook the windows for almost 5 seconds as it echoed around.

We then headed to a place called “Cici’s” for lunch, which is an all-you-can-eat pizza and pasta restaurant, and while the pizza wasn’t fantastic, it being all-you-can-eat was pretty novel and fun. They even had an arcade with the Minecraft Dungeons arcade machine! Though we didn’t want to pay $10 for the minimum amount of tickets we could get to play it.

We then went to Nathanael Greene Park while we waited for our movie time, and we played more Pokemon GO. It’s a nice park, with lots of flowers, water, and a nice river. The squirrels were out and about as well so we got to see lots of them.

At around 3 pm we headed to the theatre to see the movie. It was pretty fun seeing the decorations they’d put up for it, and the theatre was really nice as well, on par with the one we have at home. I even got some kettle corn, though it was really expensive at $6.50 USD.

We were definitely the oldest non-parents there, and there were only about 10 other people at the movie in total. The kids were making noise the whole time as per usual, but nothing too bad or unexpected.

Overall the movie was fine, it wasn’t as bad as I expected it to be, but it certainly wasn’t a blockbuster hit. I don’t think it’ll matter though, as everyone and their dog will still go to see it because of the cultural relevance. They even included a tribute to the late Technoblade which I think was a really nice touch.

We headed back home and are now just hanging around. We might go out Doordashing but we’re not too sure yet. Either way, tomorrow will be another hangout day, then we leave for more driving on Saturday after visiting Kyle’s parents an hour away.
