So, a bit of a confession. I’m actually writing this (and all the ones up to the 31st) on the 31st of March since I didn’t have time to write these over the weekend. That’s a good thing though, because my friends and I had a ton of fun in New Mexico.

I woke up today and got on the road around 11, since I wasn’t in much of a rush. I had plans to meet my friends for lunch at 1, and it was only an hour to get to Albuquerque. I got to the city and before lunch, first stopped at a store to pick up some shorts, something I had forgotten to bring with me at the start of the trip which I very much regretted upon getting to Southern California. I just got some cheap ones on discount for about $20, since I’m not much of a fashion person and I wanted to save money.

I met up with my friends for lunch at a New Mexican restaurant named “Sadie’s”, which even had their own street named after them, “Sadies Lane”! The food was great and it was really fun catching up with them. They had a show to attend at 7 (which is why they were in Albuquerque and the timing worked out), but we still had a few hours until then, so we went to a place called “Electric Playground” which was super cool. It was this warehouse filled with tons of interactive games and visual effects using projectors and motion detecting software.

Afterward, it was time for them to head out and get ready for their show, so we parted ways for the day and I headed to an Airbnb I’d booked which was just a room in a 4 room place, but it was cheap and cleaner than a motel, which was ideal.
