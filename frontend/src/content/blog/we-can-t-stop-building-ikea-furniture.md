I woke up around 3am to the sound of extremely loud thunder and lightning. I watched and listened to it for a little bit before falling back asleep and waking up at 7am. I had my doctor-prescribed (don’t fact check this) screen rot time on Instagram Reels for a little bit until I realized it was 7:45am, and Joah needed to leave at 8am. I decided to wake him up, which ended up being a good call since it turns out he needed to be at work at 8, not leave at 8.

I offered to drive him, and after a few minutes of panic and getting ready, he was ready to go and we headed down to my car. The drive wasn’t very long, only about 18 minutes, and we were able to save him 20 minutes compared to taking public transit there like he usually does. I dropped him off, and on the way back it took almost 30 minutes to get home, since rush hour was really starting now.

Joah left me with a key, since once I got back, Madeline had also headed off to work and so the doors were all locked. I used the key to get myself in, before showering and getting ready for the day, then leaving and locking the door behind me, putting the key through the mail slot for them to collect when they get home.

From there I headed back to the City Hall Library branch to write some more of these blog posts. Once I finished, I tried to work on my maps app, but I still couldn’t figure out how to get my developer tools to work on the public wifi, so I went to the Eaton Center to get lunch and try to find a Starbucks and see if their wifi would work. I got my lunch, then went to a Starbucks in the Eaton Center but couldn’t find any seating, so I went to another one a block away but it only had a few seats and they were all taken. The third one I found did have seating, and so I took a seat and got to work. Turns out, this wifi also has the same issue, but I managed to get it to work using an emulator rather than a connection to my physical device, which is a perfectly fine workaround for when I’m in public. 

Around 1:30pm I left to go pick up Sophia from work, where I arrived a few minutes early and waited in the lobby until she came down at 2pm. From work, we walked around a bit and went to the Eaton Center again to look around, since it’s pretty cool and she hadn’t really been there yet. We ended up buying me two new dress shirts, a fish related one (sharks all over it) and a green one that I can wear to Hawaii.

We then headed back to Sophia’s house but stopped at my car along the way to pick up my stuff, and then we hung out for a little bit at home to wind down. I reached out to Madilyn (I was spelling her name wrong in prior posts, sorry…!) to see if her and Joah wanted to hang out for a bit, and she said Joah wasn’t home yet but we’re welcome to come over and hang out anyway. We walked over at around 4:30 and I introduced Sophia, which ended up going very well, since Sophia and Madilyn are basically the same person, and get along extremely well.

Joah got home a little bit later and we all sat around building IKEA furniture for a few hours, until Joah and Madilyn had to go climbing with some friends around 8pm. From there, Sophia and I walked to an Indian restaurant down the road where we ate some food, and then headed out into the town. We ended up at a bar a few blocks away, 5 or so, where we caught the last 15 minutes of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game, which ended in a Leafs victory, much to the enjoyment of the people at the bar. Sophia is also turning into quite the hockey fan, and so we decided we’d try and watch the future games as well.

After the bar, we headed home and hung out for a bit longer, before calling it a night around midnight and heading to bed.
