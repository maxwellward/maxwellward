I’ll be honest, I haven’t really got around to writing these entries over the past few days. I’m now writing this on April 29th, so I need to catch up on 5 days of entries, and to make it even worse, I forgot to write down notes of what I’ve been up to! So, I’ll try my best, but these next few entries might be a bit shorter.

We started our day still in McHenry, Illinois, but by this point we figured that it was now too late for my ballot to arrive in Chicago in time to mail it back to Ottawa before the election. Because of this, we cut our losses and started heading south towards Missouri in the early afternoon. We were headed towards the capital of Illinois, Springfield. Not to be confused with Springfield, Missouri, where Kyle lives, there’s just a ton of Springfields all over the United States.

We also saw a glider on our way!

We didn’t quite make it to Springfield in time to take our photos at the capitol, so instead stayed at a rest area about 40 minutes south of the city. While not the perfect location since we’d need to backtrack in the morning, it was still the closest rest area.
